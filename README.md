# 👨‍🔧 BluBot: Elite AI News Curator

Automated AI news curator that fetches updates twice daily, synthesizes them using **Sage Intelligence (Multi-Model Failover)**, and broadcasts insightfully to **Bluesky**, **Mastodon**, and **Threads**—all running entirely for free on **GitHub Actions**.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Sage Intelligence v3 (Self-Healing AI)**: 
    - **Multi-Model Failover**: Automatically rotates through prioritized models (**`Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite`**, **`Gemma 4 31B/26B`**, **`Gemma 3 27B-IT`**) if the primary provider is saturated or fails validation.
    - **Self-Healing Loop**: Automatically corrects common AI output issues (e.g., missing hashtags) and **strips accidental markdown formatting** (bolding/italics) to ensure 100% clean posts.
    - **Self-Discovery Diagnostics**: If a model fails to validate, the bot automatically **logs every available model ID** for your key.
    - **Graceful Degradation**: If news volume is low or summarization fails, the bot intelligently degrades to "Mentor Fallback" mode.
- **🖼️ Self-Healing Image Generation (v3.6)**: 
    - **NVIDIA NIM Integration**: Uses **Stability AI Stable Diffusion 3 Medium** via NVIDIA's Inference Microservices as the primary image provider, bypassing the 100-run "Imagen restricted" blockers.
    - **Smart Image Compression**: Built-in **Pillow-powered optimizer** that automatically resizes thumbnails to platform-specific limits (fixing "blob too big" errors).
- **Elite Architecture (v3.8.2)**:
    - **🧵 The Weaver (Conditional Threading)**: Automatically chains high-resolution news analysis into platform-native threads (Bluesky, Mastodon, Threads).
    - **🥁 Thread Rhythm (v3.8.1)**: Randomized 10-30s pauses between posts to simulate human narration and prevent burst-spam detection.
    - **🤖 Dynamic Bio Management (v3.8.1)**: Profiles now showcase live telemetry and curation statistics (e.g., "1,245 stories narrated | Voice: Analytical").
    - **🛡️ Supply Chain Hardening (v3.8.2)**: Migrated to `pip-tools` with cryptographic hashes, eliminating vulnerabilities from unvetted transitive dependencies.
    - **Typed Pipeline Stages**: Immutable stages powered by frozen `dataclasses` and a typed `Settings` singleton.
    - **Advisory File Locking**: Cross-platform `FileLock` for state persistence, preventing race conditions during concurrent CI/local runs.
- **🛡️ Industrial Stabilization (v3.7.6)**: 
    - **Universal RGB Defense**: Image mode detection and conversion engine that prevents "Black/White Box" artifacts from non-standard (ArXiv) thumbnails.
    - **Resilient Rebase Logic**: Automated conflict resolution for `README.md` dashboards (using `git checkout --ours`) ensuring 100% state persistence uptime.
    - **Smart Truncation (v3.7.5)**: Word-boundary-aware trimming for Mastodon and Threads to prevent mid-word cutoffs.
- **Fortress Hardening (v3.6.5)**: 
    - **Structured JSON Logging**: Re-engineered `SafeLogger` to output machine-readable JSON with entropy-aware secret redaction (identifies keys by string-complexity).
    - **SSRF Prevention Architecture**: Hardened the metadata scraper with **DNS Pinning** and **IP validation** to block all internal/private network requests.
    - **Zero-Duplicate Threads Logic**: Implemented "Catch & Log" delivery validation to prevent duplicate posts during transient API failures.
- **🧠 Natural Vibe Engine (v3.7.0)**:
    - **Stylistic Memory**: The bot now remembers its previous "vibe" and ensures it never repeats the same tone twice in a row, switching between **Analytical**, **Practical**, **Sage**, **Concise**, and **Philosophical** dialects.
    - **Temporal Intelligence**: Upgraded from 2 to **5 granular sessions** (Dawn, Morning, Midday, Afternoon, Evening) for hyper-relevant time-of-day awareness.
    - **Manual Run "Intercept"**: Automatically detects manual `workflow_dispatch` runs and labels them as **"(Intercept)"**, shifting the AI into an urgent, ad-hoc reporting mode.
- **Breakthrough Scoring Engine v3 (Elite Signal Processing)**: 
    - **Impact-Aware Intelligence**: Prioritizes breakthrough news (Agents, SOTA) and boosts articles mentioning flagship 2026 models.
    - **Consensus Synergy Pass**: Automatically boosts "Consensus Events" reported by multiple independent feeds.

## 🛡️ Resilience Architecture (v3.8.0)

BluBot now implements a **3-Tier State Persistence** system to ensure it never "forgets" which articles it has curated, even if local storage is wiped (e.g., in ephemeral CI environments).

1.  **Tier 1: Atomic Local Storage**: Primary state is saved using atomic writes to prevent data corruption.
2.  **Tier 2: Automatic Local Backups**: On every save, the previous state is rotated to `seen_articles.json.bak`. If the primary file is corrupted, BluBot automatically restores from this backup.
3.  **Tier 3: Remote Gist Synchronization**: If `GIST_ID` and `GIST_TOKEN` are configured, BluBot pulls the state from a private GitHub Gist on startup and pushes updates back after each run. This acts as a "cloud memory" for the bot.

## 📂 Project Structure
